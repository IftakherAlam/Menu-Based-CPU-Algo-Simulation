# Menu-Based-CPU-Algo-Simulation


The interface of our program is very simple, and it gets the necessary pre-requisites from a user to run the simulation. 
Menu based CPU scheduling algorithm program is a all-in-one program where we can choose the algorithm to solve problem using 6 types of process scheduling 
algorithm. Six types of process scheduling algorithms are: 1) First Come First Serve (FCFS), 2) Shortest-Job-First (SJF),
3) Shortest Remaining Time, 4) Priority Scheduling, 5) Round Robin scheduling, 6) First Come First Serve with arrival time(FCFS). 
I used C++ language for develop this program
And also you can compare with algorithm is best for workload.
